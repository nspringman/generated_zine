Dale DeGroff, King Cocktail himself, suggests the drink as an after-dinner tipple, calling it \u201ca simple but perfect combination\u201d of ingredients.

Even if sticking to the classic gin-and-vermouth formula, there are endless gins, a number of garnishes, even different gin-to-vermouth ratios with which to customize the classic cocktail. And then there are the real twists: swapping out the gin or even the vermouth for a different spirit, or adding new flavors altogether. We won't even get into the plethora of drinks that have \"Martini\" in their name (we're looking at you, Appletini) but resemble the original in neither form nor flavor.\n"}, "Garibaldi": {"url": "https://www.liquor.com/recipes/garibaldi/", "description": "\nThis classic Italian cocktail couldn\u2019t be simpler: It combines just two ingredients, Campari and orange juice.

It\u2019s an at-home staple in the U.K., where the number of craft tonic waters on the market are virtually endless, as are craft gins which have boomed concurrently.

The book was published in London, but many believe the cocktail was created by an American.
